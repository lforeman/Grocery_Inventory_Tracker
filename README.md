How many times have you stopped at the grocery store on your way home from work and couldn't remember if you needed milk? Maybe you remember seeing a half gallon this morning, but when will it expire? How many times have you put something in the freezer only to find it months later buried underneath much fresher foods? My project will help you with these common problems. It will help you keep track of your groceries and their expiration dates. This web app will serve as a way to get organized and eliminate food waste. (According to the USDA, food waste is estimated at between 30-40 percent of the food supply in the United States.) It will begin as a way to inventory your groceries. You can enter your groceries as you buy them, or when you get home. It will also have a place to keep track of expiration dates of inventory. As it grows, it will be capable of automatically generating a shopping list based on expiration dates. It will also be capable of scanning grocery barcodes (through API). Another possible feature would be to send a text or email reminder when one of your items nears its expiration date.
